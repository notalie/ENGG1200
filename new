# Materials Module 2

## Elasticity
* Plot of load vs. extension
  * Can have linear elasticity
* Slope of the line - Young's Modulus:
$${Stress/Strain}$$
* Stiffness
  * Deflection increases with decreasing stiffness
  > Less stiff material will deflect more
  * To decrease deflection you can change material or geometry
* Elasticity is non-permanent

## Strength of Materials
$$stress = F/A$$
$$N/m^2$$ or Pa (pascals)
### Extension vs Strain
$$Strain = Extension / Unit Length Strain$$
* As samples get deformed, the volume remains approximately constatnt
* Poisson's ratio - As material is stretched, cross section gets smaller

### Types of Stress
* Tensile Stress - pulling stress, important in elasticity 
* Shear - sidways stress, important in plasticity

## Origins of Elasticity
* Attractiveness 
  - electrostatic
  - replusion - atomic force
  - bond distance
* Atomic springs
$$Modulus of Elasticity = stiff/length$$
